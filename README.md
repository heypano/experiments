## Build Commands

- All build commands for this application go through `npm` and are defined in `/package.json` under the `"scripts"` property.
- Execute each one of these scripts with `npm run scriptName`.
- When you see `npm-run-all`, that executes multiple other targets defined
- With the exception of `node`, the executables used here do **not** need to be installed on the running system, as npm will look under the `/node_modules/.bin` folder
- If a script is called `scriptName`, npm will automatically call `prescriptName` before its invocation and `postscriptName` after.
- Make sure to run `npm install` before attempting anything (only once, unless modules are upgraded in the `package.json`)

### Building for Production

#### `npm run build`
